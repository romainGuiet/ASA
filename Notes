Sholl Analysis, http://fiji.sc/Sholl_Analysis

WISH LIST
=========
    - Fitting to polynomials of higher degree
    - Fix dialog prompt: Can become higher than 700px and may not be displayed on netbooks
    - Restrict analysis to area ROIs (rather than hemicircles/spheres?)
    - Obtain a mask for every chosen method (slices of an ImageStack?)


RELEASE NOTES
=============
   (Unfortunately, the numbering scheme is somewhat arbitrary and not that meaningful.
    However, large increments usually indicate changes in the user interface).


TESTING VERSION
---------------
   This is the latest development version. It will be available through the Fiji updater
   once new features mature. It may break previous macros you may have written. Builds for
   this 'pre-release' are available at http://jenkins.imagej.net/job/Sholl-Analysis/

Version 3.4b (January 2014) [Testing version]
    - Guesses which of the normalization methods (semi-log or log-log) is the most
      informative using the concept of 'determination ratio'
    - Added 2nd and 3rd polynomials as fitting choices


STABLE VERSIONS
---------------
   These are all the 'stable' builds made available through http://fiji.sc/Sholl_Analysis
   and the Fiji Updater

Version 3.3 (December 2013) [latest release]
    - Calculates skewness and kurtosis for both sampled and fitted data
    - Fixed v3.1 bug in which values from log-log plot were not listed in table

Version 3.2 (August 2013)
    - Enclosing radius is defined as the widest distance associated with a specified
      cutoff value of intersection counts. At the default cutoff (1), it is the largest
      of intersecting radii.

Version 3.1
    - Hold dow "Alt" to analyze profiles obtained elsewhere, including those from Simple
      Neurite Tracer, http://fiji.sc/Simple_Neurite_Tracer
    - Multiple profiles can be obtained at once
    - Plugin can now predict (or at least try) the polynomial of best approximation
    - New descriptors: Median and Barycenter of sampled profile
    - Added a "batch mode" option that saves profiles without displaying them
    - Sholl decay is calculated using the full rage of data or values within percentiles
      10 and 90, which usually provides a better fit. However, Sholl decay is only
      calculated when logarithmic methods are chosen (v2.2 behavior)
    - Normalization can be performed against: Area of circle/Volume of sphere, Perimeter
      of circumference/Surface of sphere or Area of annulus/Volume of spheric shell.
    - Made main dialog more intuitive. This may brake previous macros created with the
      Macro Recorder
    - Barycenter and other descriptors are highlighted on plot
    - Updated the URL of help page to http://fiji.sc/Sholl_Analysis/
    - Eliminated the "Sholl LUT" command (with IJ 1.48a an later LUTs of non-8-bit TIFFs
      are saved with the image)
    - Sholl mask reports only values from "Linear Sholl". "Semi-log" and "Linear-norm."
      masks are no longer created. This could be reinstated if needed

Version 3.0
    - 3D Sholl:
      - Better handling of anisotropic voxels
      - Option to ignore isolated (noise) voxels
      - Minimized rounding errors related to digitization of spheres
    - 2D Sholl:
      - Substituted "Radius span" with "Samples per radius" to avoid misinterpretations of
        the former parameter. A draconian maximum of 10 "Samples per radius" is
        deliberately imposed to encourage "Continuos Sholl"
    - General improvements:
      - 3D and 2D algorithms are ~25% faster (3D analysis remains rather slow)
      - Allows thresholded grayscale images as input
      - Analyzes polarized arbors by restricting the analysis to hemicircles/hemispheres.
        This requires the user to define the center of analysis with an orthogonal radius,
        using the Straight Line Tool and holding Shift
      - Arbor size is calculated as the area/volume of the smallest bounding circle/sphere
        containing the segmented arbor
      - When "End radius" is empty (or NaN), the largest (hemi)circle/sphere is used. This
        allows macros to easily process images without line selections
      - Precision (Scientific notation and number of decimal places) in Sholl table is set
        by "Analyze>Set Measurements..."
      - Sholl mask is coded with Matlab's "jet" color map
      - Major code clean up, which solved several issues
      - Plugin is now registered in the Analyze Menu: "Analyze>Sholl Analysis...".
        Implemented the auxiliary commands "File>Open Samples>ddaC neuron" (2D sample
        image), "Image>Lookup Tables>Sholl LUT" and "Help>About Plugins...>Sholl Plugins"
      - Prettified plot

Version 3d
    - 3D Analysis is now restricted to the volume of each Sholl shell, rather than parsing
      all the segmented voxels

Version 3c
    - 3D Sholl is usable for the first time, but remains extremely slow

Version 3a-b
    - Experimental: Performs 3D Sholl without spike suppression if input image is a stack

Version 2.5
    - Fixed duplicated points in Bresenham's algorithm
    - Option to save data on image directory, if available
    - Long analyses can be aborted by holding Esc

Version 2.4
    - Fixed a 2.3 regression in which -1 tagged pixels were being counted
    - Improved Sholl mask: Minimized rounding errors. Center of analysis is now marked
    - Improved Sholl Table and Plot display

Version 2.3
    - Results are printed to a dedicated table
    - Sholl decay is always calculated
    - Fixed exception in the calculation of critical value in non bell-shaped profiles
    - Impose valid parameters in dialog, rather than keep prompting the user (which was
      not amenable to macro recording)
    - Major code cleaning

Version 2.1-2
    - Fixed several bugs and regressions introduced in version 2.0
    - Checks for reasonable Radius span values

Version 2.0
     - Curve Fitting, modernization of Tom's code

Version 1.0
     - Initial version by Tom Maddock
